    <h2>Tips for New Referees</h2>
    <p>
      Officiating youth basketball games taught me many valuable lessons about
      communication, focus and impartiality. Whether you're blowing a whistle
      for the first time or looking to sharpen your skills, the following
      qualities can help you succeed on the court:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Knowledge of the Rules
      </li>
      <li>
        Communication Skills
        <ul>
          <li>Use clear and consistent hand signals.</li>
          <li>Blow the whistle confidently to stop play.</li>
          <li>Speak calmly with coaches and players when explaining calls.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Physical Fitness and Positioning
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Official Hand Signals</h2>
    <p>
      Hand signals allow referees to communicate decisions quickly and clearly.
      Learning and practising these gestures ensures that players, coaches and
      spectators understand what is being called without confusion. Below is a
      short video that demonstrates some common basketball referee signals:

    <h2>Personal Anecdotes</h2>
    <p>
      One Saturday morning, I had to make a tough call when a player took an
      extra step before shooting. The crowd was divided, and some parents were
      upset. I signalled a travel, then explained my reasoning to the coach. By
      staying calm and respectful, I maintained control of the game and kept
      tensions from escalating. Moments like this taught me the importance of
      composure and confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serving as a referee also helped me learn how to work under pressure.
      Whether balancing loud spectators or ensuring player safety, I developed
      leadership skills that have transferred into other jobs and studies.
